# About the repository

In here you find all slides, texts, graphs and information about the course.

There is a `SlideServer` to run a web server to present the contents in slide
form.
Starting this can be done with:

- Vagrant and VM [Vagrant Based Instructions](Vagrant_SlideServer_Instructions.md)
- Bundle on PC [Bundle Instructions](Bundle_SlideServer_Instructions.md)

There is also a predefined way to install and run a _develpoment_ vm.
-> [Developmet VM with Vagrand](Vagrant_Development_Instructions.md)
