      ## What is a data?

      In programming the material to work with can be classified in two types

      1. Primitive Data
      2. Structured Data

  %section

      #### What is Meta-Data?

      __Meta-Data__ describes information, about _data_, that informs aspects of
      this _data_

    %pre
      %code.hljs
        :escaped
          Stefan Koenen is a Person
          Stefan is a Name

  %section
    :markdown
      ## Primitive Data

      This form of data is a representation with no or minimal _Meta-Data_.

  %section
    :markdown
      ## Structured Data

      Descibes data that is grouped and has additional meaning attached.
      Either due to the

      - Declaration naming _or_
      - How data is grouped

      ### SD | Meta-Data by declaration

      Structural infomation about the data results by the definition as an
      array of _int_ values.

    %pre
      %code.c.hljs
        :escaped
          int arr[32];

          arr[0];
          arr[1]

          class Street {
            String streetName;

      # Packages

      A package is a structure with finite amount of attributes.

      Often also called:

      - Object
      - Structure
      - Unit
      - Box

      __Important:__ Do not confuse with Java `package`

      Package Example

    %pre
      %code.java.hljs
        class Lecture {
          int numberOfPages;
          String[] pages;
        }

    %p

      # Collections

      A collection is a structure that is able to have a variable amount of data
      elements.

      These can be divided into three types:

      1. Ordered Collections
      2. Unordered Collections
      3. Assoziative Collections

      ## Collections and Elements

      A collection element is representation of one value of the data inside a
      collection.

  %section

      ## Ordered Collections

      Ordered collections have defined order.

      The most cases the order is relying on the order elements are put into the
      collection.

      Or the position where an element is put into the collection, has to be
      expicitly given.
