      ## What are control structures?

      A _control structure_ is an instruction to change the next executed
      instructions, in relation to a _condition_.

      ### CS | Logical value

      All _control structures_ use a logical value, that is mostly the
      representation of the result of an expression.

      In most languages there is a special data type called __Boolean__ that
      can represent either

      - `TRUE` for a positive evaluation
      - `FALSE` for a negative evaluation

      ### CS | Logical value

      Note:

      Only __C__ does not have a data type fot this.
      The representation is done with

      - `> 0` for positive evaluation
      - `<= 0` for negative evaluation

    ## CS | Sequential

    The sequential _control structure_, is representing the default flow
    decision.
    It determines, that every instruction is executed in the order they are
    listed in the program.

      ## CS | Selection

      A selection _control structure_ can be viewed as a branch.
      In its simplest form it contians two possible lists of instructions that
      can be executed.

      ### CS | Selection | IF

      The simplest selecting structure is `IF`.

      This control structure has a list of instructions, that are __only__
      executed if a _condition_ is evaluated to `TRUE`

    %pre
      %code.rust.hljs
        fn main() {
        }

      ## CS | Repetition

      A repition _control structure_ can be used to let the computer _repeat_
      a list of instructions several times.

      ## CS | Repeat | WHILE

      This repetition structure has a list of instructions, that are executed
      __as long__ as a _condition_ is evaluated to `TRUE`
