      ## Difficulty of computation

      If a problem requires significant resources to be solved, no matter which
      algorithm is used, this problem is considered difficult.

      ## Computational Theory

      Therefore computational complexity theory is the way to determine practical
      limitations what problems can be solved by a computer.

      Main classifications:

      - **P** => Polynominal Problems
      - **NP** => Non-Deterministic Polynominal Problems

      ## Millennium Prize Problems

      The [Clay Mathematics Institute](http://www.claymath.org/) has stated on
      2000-05-24 seven mathematical problems to the public to be solved.

      It also rewards the discoverer __US $ 1 million__.

      2. [Riemann Hypothesis](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/riemann-hypothesis)
      3. [P vs NP Problem](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/p-vs-np-problem)
      4. [Navier-Stokes Equation](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/navier%E2%80%93stokes-equation)
      5. [Hodge Conjecture](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/hodge-conjecture)

      ## P vs NP Problem

      The question is, if the solution to a problem that can be quickly verified
      can also be solved quickly (again, in polynominal time).
